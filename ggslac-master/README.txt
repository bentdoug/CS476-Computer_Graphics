I do not wish to post my art contest submission publicly- It is not my best work, did not have time to make it interesting
My art contest submission is a smiley face with a big dinosaur approaching. This fufills the requirements of utalizing two scene files and having child nodes
It took me probably around 6-8 hrs to complete this assignment
This project was interesting, I enjoyed working on it however the dinosaur circle got a little frustrating. I did not feel totally prepared to do this assignment but was able to figure it out.
My dino.js does not render in browser however I made it log the resulting string to the console. This way, I was able to get the json code and create the dino dance circle succesfully.
